### MubRPC
Allows for sending of all standard MuBdI commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### Looking for Wallet Tools?
MubRPC.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. Their respective commands in BitRPC.py are:

	mubrpc.py walletpassphrasechange
	mubrpc.py walletpassphrase
