MuBdI Core version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/nur1labs/mubdi/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/nur1labs/mubdi/issues>


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/MuBdI-Qt (on Mac) or mubdid/mubdi-qt (on Linux).

Notable Changes
==============

(Developers: add your notes here as part of your pull requests whenever possible)


### Deprecated autocombinerewards RPC Command

The `autocombinerewards` RPC command was soft-deprecated in v5.3.0 and replaced with explicit setter/getter commands `setautocombinethreshold`/`getautocombinethreshold`. PIVX Core, by default, will no longer accept the `autocombinerewards` command, returning a deprecation error, unless the `pivxd`/`pivx-qt` is started with the `-deprecatedrpc=autocombinerewards` option.

This command will be fully removed in v6.0.0.
